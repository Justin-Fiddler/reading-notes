# Programming with JavaScript

## Notes

The **control flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution. [^1]

A JavaScript **function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). [^2]

Declaring a function means making a command/rule

A JavaScript function is defined with the ***function keyword***, followed by a ***name***, followed by ***parentheses ()***. Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...) The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {} [^2]

>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
>  // code to be executed
>}

***Function parameters*** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. ***Function arguments*** are the values received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables. [^2]

***Function Invocation***
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked) [^2]

**Function Declaration vs Function Expression**

- A function declaration
- Function Expression can only call it after it has been defined in the code.
