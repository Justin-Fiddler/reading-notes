## Thoughts on the "Growth Mindset"

The growth mindset is a way to overcome self-doubt through persistance, but persistance must be fueled by motivation. Personally, my motivation comes from my competitive nature. I understand that if I am to become a professional in the tech world, I will be joining a large pool of experienced professionals. In this case, the only way to stand out is to continue learning. Every difficult task I complete on this learning journey pushes me just a little closer to the top. So when I fail a task, it must be looked at as an oppurtunity.  

### Growth mindset reminders:
- way 1
- way 2
- way 3
