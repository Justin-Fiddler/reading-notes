# Structure web pages with HTML

## Notes

### Wireframe and Design

#### What is Wireframe?

A UX blueprint of the information hierarchy in a digital design like a website, app, or other product.

Guided by user research, UX designers and clients work together to structure information they want the viewer to digest.

A blueprint is important because it guides the developers creating code for the buttons, menus and boxes. A blueprint or wireframe can be designed by a developer or a UX designer.
